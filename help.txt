/* ptrdiff_t */
ptrdiff_t is the name of a type, like int or ::std::string.
The C++ standard promises that this type will be an integer type
large enough to hold the difference between any two pointers that
you can subtract. Of course, the idea of subtracting pointers is
a rather foreign concept in Java. In order to be able to do this,
ptrdiff_t must be able to hold negative numbers.
